# Command Line Interface (CLI)

If you are using Windows have the Git Bash package installed, since you'll be learning \*nix commands for the following actions.


## Rule \#1 of command line

**Always know where you are** `pwd`

## Basic commands

1. `cd` - change directory.
1. `pwd` - print working directory; show where you are.
1. `mkdir` - make directory.
1. `ls` - list contents of a directory.
1. `clear` - clear the view.
1. `touch` - create file. 
1. `cat` - read the contents of a file.
1. `cp` - copy files and directories.
1. `mv` - move files and directories.
1. `rm ` - remove a single file
1. `rm -rf` - remove a directory and all of its contents


## Advanced commands & options

1. Perform actions that affect the entire machine with `sudo`
1. Quickly edit files with vim `vim filename`
1. Use `mkdir -p` to automatically make every directory in a new path
1. Use wildcards when moving or copying files, e.g. `cp *.js ./`
1. Use the `-r` option with `mv` or `cp` to recursively perform the action on all sub-directories
1. Use double bang `!!` to repeat last command, or prefix it with `sudo`, for example.

## Aliases and Functions in Bash

### Aliases

Aliases are useful for accelerating your development workflow. You define aliases in your `.zshrc` file with the `alias` keyword. Let's look at an example.

When working with the Git/Github workflow, there are several commands that you type over, and over, and over again. One of those is `git push origin myBranchName`. It becomes tedious to constantly type `git push origin`. Let's create an alias for it.

Open the `.zshrc` initialization file in your favorite code editor, and enter in the following alias.

`alias gpo="git push origin "`

> **Pro tip:** Make sure there are no spaces before, or after, the equals sign in an alias.

Save the file, and reload your init file with the `source` command.

`source ~/.zshrc`

The next time you need to push a local branch to Github, you can use this alias to save yourself a lot of typing.

`gpo myBranchName`

### Functions

A function let's you combine mutiple commands, and accept parameters for those commands. Let's look at an example.

During the course, you will often be creating directories on your file system, and then immediately navigating to that directory.

```sh
mkdir MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp
```

Let's create a bash function to accelerate that workflow. Open `.zshrc` and enter in the following function.

 ```sh
mg() {
  [ -n "$1" ] && mkdir -p "$@" && cd $_;
}
 ```

`mg` is shorthand for `make and goto`. Source your init file, and then try it out.

```sh
mg MyAwesomeApp
```

It will create the directory and then immeidate `cd` to it.

## What is a Shell?

At its base, a shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands. The term macro processor means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.

A bash shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of utilities for your operating system. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. Files containing commands can be created, and become commands themselves. These new commands have the same status as system commands in directories such as /bin, allowing users or groups to establish custom environments to automate their common tasks.

Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.

Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins) implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities. For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot be implemented outside of the shell because they directly manipulate the shell itself. The history, getopts, kill, or pwd builtins, among others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more convenient to use as builtin commands. All of the shell builtins are described in subsequent sections.

While executing commands is essential, most of the power (and complexity) of shells is due to their embedded programming languages. Like any high-level language, the shell provides variables, flow control constructs, quoting, and functions.

Shells offer features geared specifically for interactive use rather than to augment the programming language. These interactive features include job control, command line editing, command history and aliases.

# Want to learn more?

Use the `man` command to learn more about the other commands below. For example, `man touch` tells you everything you need to know about the `touch` command. Just press `q` when you're done reading the content.

1. **List all processes on your machine**. Learn about the `ps` command to find processes on your machine. For advanced usage, combine it with grep to find a specific process.
1. **View processes, live, with stats**. Try the `top` command to monitor running processes in real time.
1. **curl your way on the Web**. You can "surf the web" on the command line using `curl`. Read the docs and see what happens when you use `curl` instead of a web browser.
1. **Find the process using a port**. There's a way to see which port every process that's running is listening on (if applicable). It's `lsof -i`. To find the process listening on a specific port, you add a second argument that is the port number - `lsof -i :8080`.
1. **Securely connect to remote machines**. The `ssh` command allows you to use the CLI of another computer - whether it's a virtual machine running on your personal computer, or a server running in one of Amazon's server farms.

# Practice

1. Create the following directory structure in your `workspace` directory.
    ```sh
    workspace
    +-- cli
        +-- practice
            +-- create
    ```
1. `cd` to the `create` directory with one command `cd ~/workspace/cli/practice/create`. Remember to use tab completion.
1. While in this directory, create a new file named `foo` in the `cli` directory. Do not `cd` to `cli`, but rather use your navigation abilities. 
    ```sh
    touch ../../foo
    ```
1. Put some simple content in the file using the `echo` command.
    ```sh
    echo 'Foo, I am your father' > ../../foo
    ```
1. Now use the `cat` command to read those contents.
    ```sh
    cat ../../foo
    ```
1. Do not change directories, and create a file named `bar` in the `practice` directory.
1. Remove the `foo` file you created earlier with the `rm` command.
1. `cd` back up to the `cli` directory.
1. Remove the `practice` directory and all of its contents.

## Aliases

1. To make a new branch with git, you use the command `git checkout -b branchName`. Make an alias for yourself to save on typing.
1. Likely the most used git command is `git status`. Alias it as `gs`.

## Functions

1. Another process that is done many times during the course is initializing a new git repo on your machine.

    ```sh
    git init
    git remote add origin GithubRemoteURL
    touch .gitignore
    ```

    Make a function that automates this for you, where you simply type in the function name followed by the new repo URL.
1. Once you have that working, augment the function to autopopulate the `.gitignore` with standard files and functions that should be ignored with the `echo` command.
